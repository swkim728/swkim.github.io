          <p>Github repository link can be found <a href = "https://github.com/skim09/SWE_Team_Links" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>During my internship at Samsung SDS America (SDSA) from June 2019 to August 2019, I had the opportunity to work with the internal applications team and a new technology that was recently introduced to the company, called <b>Brity Works</b>. It was the latest effort by Samsung SDS to get into the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market and ultimately Intelligent Process Automation (IPA). Built by developers back in SDS headquarters in Seoul, it was still in a beta development stage, but it was powerful enough to be released to SDSA and was introduced as a time-saving and efficiency solution for employees.</p>

          <p>The internal applications team was tasked with learning how to use Brity Works first, and then teaching it to all other employees and helping them create their <i>own</i> automated processes. I spent many hours helping other Samsung employees implement their visions of automated computer tasks through Brity Works (which emulates a user's input, such as clicks, keyboard inputs, text inputs, etc.). The SDS CEO had high expectations for Brity Works and hoped to see many employees making use of this technology. The internal applications team (including myself) decided that one of the best ways to get people familiar with the technology would be to release a company-wide process that everybody could use and thus experience first-hand the power of automated process technology and implement it into their daily lives.</p>

          <p>The idea that we came up with was a process that would automatically access an employee's training data on their HR portal and inform them of whether they satisfied the training requirements for the year. I was give the task of building the process myself, and I was able to create a process using Brity Works that automatically accessed an employee's HR portal, downloaded and calculated the number of hours they've received in the current period, and emailed the respective employee with an excel file of their hours and whether they satisfied their training requirements, and how many hours under/over the requirements they are. My process, once it was finished, was distributed to the entire employee base across Samsung SDSA, and I continued to help employees implement my process, even using a remote desktop software to help SDSA employees in California and Texas.</p>

          <p>The future of RPA technology is so much more diverse than a simple user emulation software. Before my internship at Samsung SDSA ended I helped install RPA bots onto virtual machines on the Samsung cloud infrastructure, so that people can queue up tasks onto virtual machines and an orchestrator schedules tasks and manages routine repeated processes so that these cloud computers can continuously be running processes that can be automated.</p>

          <p>The development of Brity Works (and all RPA technologies) does not end there. Brity Works aims to be a conversational process automation solution by implementing a "chatbot" onto user's systems so that whenever the user needs an automated task to be run, it can ask the chatbot, which runs the according task on a remote server. RPA technology often employs OCR technology that even better simulates human activity by reading images and displays as inputs just as we read and view screens as inputs for ourselves. Ultimately RPA looks to combine the conscious capabilities of the human user with the speed and inexhaustability of computers.</p>
