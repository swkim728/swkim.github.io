          <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Studies have shown relationships of financial behavior with external factors such as financial literacy and education methods as well as internal factors like self-esteem and sense of coherence with other people.</li>
              <li>Financial literacy influences financial behavior, and an individual’s perceived financial literacy may be as important as actual financial literacy (Allgood et al., 2016).</li>
              <li>In a more psychological dimension, studies have shown that self-esteem significantly relates to financial behavior positively, subject to varying financial knowledge (Tang et al., 2016).</li>
              <li>This suggests that there are certain correlations between a person’s psychological tendencies and their economic health, but it has not been studied extensively.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><b>Research Question</b></p>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Is there an association between one’s level of optimism and their financial well-being?</li>
              <li>Does this association vary across different economic classes?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Methodology</h2>

          <p><b>Sample</b></p>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Data from National Financial Well-Being Survey (NFWBS) conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in 2016.</li>
              <li>Survey sample drawn from GfK KnowledgePanel</li>
              <li>Population: Sample represents the noninstitutionalized adult (18+) population in the United States.</li>
              <li>Overall sample size was 6394 participants.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><b>Measures</b></p>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Financial well-being scale score constructed using Item Response Theory methods developed by the CFPB.</li>
              <li>Represents individual’s overall financial health and ability to manage money.</li>
              <li>Financial well-being scale constructed by a 10-item survey each with 5 response options ranging from “Never” to “Always” or “Does not describe me at all” to “Describes me completely”.</li>
              <li>NFWBS optimism survey question “I am optimistic about my future” has response options from a scale to 1 to 7, with 1 being “Strongly disagree” and 7 being “Strongly agree”.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>

          <p><b>Univariate</b></p>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Average financial well-being scale score was 56, with the lowest being 14 and the highest being 95.</li>
              <li>A large proportion of people responded as being optimistic towards their future, with 26% “strongly agree” and 29% “agree”.</li>
              <li>But only 2.1% “strongly disagree” and 2.2% “disagree”.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><b>Bivariate</b></p>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Linear regression analysis showed that people who responded positively to the question of optimism were significantly more likely to have a higher financial well-being score.</li>
              <li>Compared to “strongly disagree”, “strongly agree” responders on average had a higher FWB score of 17.2. “Agree” responders were 16.2 points higher, “Somewhat agree” were 9.8 points higher, and “Neither” were 6.5 points higher. For all of these results, at least p < 0.000001 (Figure 1).</li>
              <li>“Somewhat disagree” and “Disagree” responders had no statistically significant difference with “Strongly disagree”.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p><b>Multivariate</b></p>
          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Positive responses to optimism maintained its significance of at least p < 0.00001 after controlling for other possible confounding variables such as education, ethnicity, gender, generation, and poverty level.</li>
              <li>FWB scores were lower for individuals in lower poverty levels (as expected), but the positive association between optimism and financial well-being was still present with a significance of p < 0.000001 (Figure 2).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            <ul class = "dashed">
              <li>Individuals that are more optimistic about their future are more likely to have higher financial well-being scores, but there is no significant difference between negative responses themselves.</li>
              <li>Poverty level is significantly correlated with financial well-being, and the association between optimism and financial well-being holds true within poverty levels.</li>
              <li>Such a result suggests that going forwards efforts in improving financial well-being may need to incorporate one’s psychological values in addition to other external factors such as financial literacy.</li>
              <li>Further research is required into determining causality, and it also opens the discussion of what other psychological or philosophical ideals influence one’s financial well-being and health.</li>
            </ul>
